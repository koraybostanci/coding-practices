# __Walking Through a Problem__

## __Listen__

* pay very attention to any information in the problem description

## __Example__

* create an example, possibly on the white-board.
* be specific (ex: for data types; int, string etc)
* not too small, sufficiently large
* use real values
* do not use a special case

## __Brute Force__

* state a brute-force solution as soon as possible, do not worry about complexity.  then optimize from there.
* even if the solution is obvious, it's better to provide it, because the interviewer can not know if you've struggled to give the easy solution or not.

## __Test the idea__

* conceptual test, basic case test, edge case test

## __Optimize__

* look for any unused information which is told in the question but not used in the solution (ex: array is sorted)
* use BUD optimization (Bottlenecks, Unnecessary Work, Duplicated Work)
* make time & memory complexity trade-off
* consider if a precomputation of some values is possible
* consider using a cache
* think about the best conceivable runtime

## __Walk through the final solution__

* do not dive into code
* know what the variables and when they change
* if you do not understand what you're about to write, you'll struggle to code it

## __Implement the solution__

* start coding in the far left of the board
* keep talking while writing the code
* everything counts, write beautiful code
* beautiful code means ; modularized code, error checks, good variable names, using classes/structs where applicable

## __Test the code__

* you should not submit code in an interview without test
* conceptual test
* basic tests
* edge case tests
