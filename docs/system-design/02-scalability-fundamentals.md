# __Scalability Fundamentals__

## __Everything is a tradeoff__

Designing a scalable system is an optimization task: there are tons of constraints (time, budget, knowledge, complexity, technologies currently available, etc.), and you need to build the best thing that fits those constraints. Every technology, every pattern is great for some things, and not so great for others. Understanding these pros and cons, the advantages and disadvantages, is key.

There is no one optimal system design. There are best practices you can use. But at the end of the day, it all boils down to balancing between time to market, system complexity, cost of development, cost of maintenance, availability, and many ,other things.

Being able to understand and discuss these trade-offs is what system design (and thus system design questions) is all about.

Donâ€™t try to find silver bullets. Instead, focus on what each scalability pattern is good for, what its shortcomings are, and why people prefer it over other patterns.

## __At the interview__

So what should you do at your interview?

First of all, follow the System Design Process. You already know how to apply it, so we'll be brief. Don't skip steps, don't make assumptions, start broad and go deep when asked.

Second, keep in mind that system design questions serve as an idea exchange platform. Be prepared for discussions about tradeoffs, about pros and cons. Be prepared to give alternatives, to ask questions, to identify and solve bottlenecks, to go broad or deep depending on your interviewer's preferences.

Don't get defensive: whenever your interviewer challenges your architectural choices, acknowledge that rarely an idea is perfect, and outline the advantages and disadvantages of your choice. Be open to new constraints to pop up during the discussion and to adjust your architecture on the fly.

Most of all, have fun. Dreaming up architectures is a very stimulating mental process - enjoy it and stay positive. You're already equipped with the right knowledge, just apply it during your interview and you'll do well.
