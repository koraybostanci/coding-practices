# __Array & Arraylist__

## __Array :__

* in some languages arrays are automatically resizable but in java arrays have fixed length. the size is defined while creating the array.

## __ArrayList :__

* is the resizable implementation of array. When the array is full, it doubles in size. Each doubling takes O(N) time, but this happens rarely that amortized insertion time is O(1).
