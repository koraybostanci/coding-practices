# How to Prepare for Behavioral Questions

## __Introduction__

* Be specific. Describe the specific parts you implemented.
* Interviews are fundamentally an individual assesment. Focus on yourself, not the team.
* Give structured answers.
* User __(S)ituation (A)ction (R)esult__  approach. Start with outlining the situation, then explaining the action you took and lastly describing the result. Action is the most important part of the story but far too many people talk on the situation. Instead dive into action, break down action into multiple parts if possible. Try to prepare the stories according to the following perspectives.
  * Initiative/Leardership
  * Humility
  * Teamwork
  * Empathy
  * Compassion

## __Interview Preparation Grid__

* Challenges
* Mistakes/Failures
* Enjoyed
* Leadership
* Conflict
* What You'd Do Differently (Choices of technologies (tradeoffs), architecture, technical decisions)

* Give 2 projects as example for each category.
* Reduce each story to just a couple of keywords to make the grid easier to study and recall.
* Have the grid in front of you during the interview.
* Have 1-3 projects that you can talk about in detail.
* Have metrics with you : Give specific examples for load senarios.
  * Active session count for last one minute
  * Request per second in average
  * Request per second in load
  * Response time in average
  * Response time in load
