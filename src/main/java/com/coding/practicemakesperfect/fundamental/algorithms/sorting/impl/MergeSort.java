/*
 *
 * Description :
 *   A merge sort works recursively. First it divides a data set in half, and sorts each half separately.
 * Next, the first elements from each of the two lists are compared. The lesser element is then removed
 * from its list and added to the final result list.
 *
 * Heap sort and Merge sort always have time complexity O(N * log N) regardless of the input.
 *
 * Complexity :
 *   Runtime : O(N * log N)
 *   Memory  : Depends
 *
